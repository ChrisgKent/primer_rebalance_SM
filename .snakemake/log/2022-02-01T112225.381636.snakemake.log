Error in rule coverage:
    jobid: 1
    output: results/coverage/[].bed
    shell:
        bedtools coverage -a results/amplicons.bed -b  -f 0.5 > results/coverage/[].bed
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job coverage since they might be corrupted:
results/coverage/[].bed
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
